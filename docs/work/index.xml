      <description>Senior Capstone  10 Weeks to Build a Real World Software Project    As part of the Stanford computer science major, all seniors have to spend 10 weeks building a significantly sized software project for their senior capstone. We would be evaluated on our ability to work cohesively as a team (peer reviews), individual code contributions (github review), and the project’s level of execution and completion (project fair).  Our team of 4 built the software and assembled the hardware behind Lumi, a gesture-controlled smart mirror that plays music, takes photos, and displays glanceable information like the time, the weather, and your twitter feed.</description>

      <description>Background    On-demand food and grocery delivery startups have taken off in the last several years. However, on-demand retail delivery still seems to be almost non-existent. Firsthand Delivery was a pivot of a startup I founded in 2017 that attempts to test the value proposition of a retail delivery service.
